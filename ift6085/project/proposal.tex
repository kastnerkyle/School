\subsection*{Introduction}
The goal of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is to have a robot
which is able to be placed in an unknown environment and learn the obstacles
and potential paths available, while also learning where (in relation to these
obstacles) it is. Without systems that can be placed in new environments and
\emph{learn} to operate, many applications will remain off-limits to robotics.
SLAM is an active research area in the robotics community, with several key
components coming from research in statistics, computer vision, and
machine learning. The proposed approach falls into the the category of
monocular (single-camera) visual (video sensors only) SLAM. 

\subsection*{Possible Data Sources}
There are a wide variety of publicly available datasets for SLAM testing. Since
this project will focus primarily on visual SLAM using a single camera, the
dataset from \emph{M. Cummins and P. Newman, “Fab-map: Probabilistic localization
and mapping in the space of appearance”} will provide an ideal 
reference for prototyping and testing coded algorithsm. It is also planned to
gather more data using a small quadrotor in a controlled environment, to test
different strengths and weaknesses of the variational autoencoder versus the
standard algorithms used in visual SLAM.

\subsection*{Project Stages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement basic variational autoencoder on faces or audio
    \item Implement or find reference implementation of minimal SLAM pipeline
    \item Extend into basic visual SLAM pipeline
    \item Integrate variational autoencoder into pipeline, replacing necessary
        parts of previous implementations
    \item Compare the two visual SLAM implementations on several datasets
\end{itemize}
